 All that I want
Is to wake up fine
Tell me that I'm all right
That I ain't gonna die
All that I want
Is a hole in the ground
You can tell me when it's alright
For me to come out
Hard times Gonna make you wonder why you even try
Hard times Gonna take you down and laugh when you cry
These lives And I still don't know how I even survive
Hard times
Hard times
And I gotta hit rock bottom
Walking around
With my little rain cloud
Hanging over my head
And it ain't coming down
Where do I go?
Gimme some sort of sign
You hit me with lightning!
Maybe I'll come alive
Hard times Gonna make you wonder why you even try
Hard times Gonna take you down and laugh when you cry
These lives And I still don't know how I even survive
Hard times
Hard times
And I gotta hit rock bottom
Tell my friends I'm coming down
We'll kick it when I hit the ground
Tell my friends I'm coming down
We'll kick it when I hit the ground
When I hit the ground
When I hit the ground
When I hit the ground
When I hit the ground
Hard times Gonna make you wonder why you even try
Hard times Gonna take you down and laugh when you cry
These lives And I still don't know how I even survive
Hard times
Hard times
And I gotta hit rock bottom
Hard times
Makes you wonder why you even try
Makes you wonder why you even try
Makes you wonder why you even try
Makes you wonder
Hard times
Still don't know how I even survive
Still don't know how I even survive
Still don't know how I even survive
Still don't know how
I survive
And I gotta get to rock bottom
